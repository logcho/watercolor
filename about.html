                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>
                        A casual conversation then turned into the start of a business...<br>
                        <br>
                        Abraham and Abhinav planned to have dinner to talk about their schoolwork, 
                        but things took a turn for the better. When talking about their classes, 
                        Abraham pitched the idea about starting a business: a mobile gaming company. 
                        With the experience Abhinav had already, he was eager to re-enter back into the gaming industry. 
                        The company was created in March 2023. There have been many obstacles and challenges, but Watercolor 
                        still remains relevant today.

                    <h2>Purpose</h2>
                    <p>
                        When Abraham entered the mobile gaming industry, he realized the unfairness within
                        the industry. Small developers were forced to sell their beloved games to mainstream 
                        publishers for little to no compensation. Abraham envisions Watercolor to be a trailblazer 
                        for small developers and believes any individual is able to release a successful game. 
                        Mainstream publishers will be a thing of the past, and developers will be able to flourish in the near acure

                    <h2>Commitment</h2>
                    <p>
                        Watercolor vows to innovate the mobile gaming industry. We plan to be a challenger 
                        towards other companies. As a company we understand the obligations we need to fulfill 
                        in order to satisfy the user's expectations and their experience. Watercolor stands on 
                        their motto: Whenever & Wherever. We believe a true mobile game should be able to be played 
                        Whenever and can be accessible wherever throughout the word.
